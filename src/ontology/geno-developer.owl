        <obo:DAO_0000001>At the class level, it is important to use has_part at the level of decomposing genomic variation complements into their variant single locus complements, because often this is a refelxive relation (ie in cases where there is only one variant single locus complement).  At the instance level, choose has_proper_part when the genomic variation complement individual has more than one variant single locus complement as part.

Similarly, at the class level we use has_part to relate a variant single locus to a sequence alteration part, because there are cases where this is a reflexive relation (e.g. transgenic insertions where the sequence alteration spans the entire variant locus).  At the instance level, we can choose has_proper_part when the variant single locus individual is not variant in its entire extent, and therefore the sequence alteration it contains is not equivalent in extent to the variant locus.</obo:DAO_0000001>

        <obo:DAO_0000002>1. Consider if we want genotypes to be defined to necessarily have alternate and reference parts, or just variant parts.  As defined now, therear enecessarily reference and alternate parts (ie either a genomic background or a reference locus for each variant position genotyped).  but we can always generalize things if we find genotypes that are just collections of variant data - e.g. what SNP is present for a set of variant loci, with no indication of a reference locus at each of these sites.  If this is the case, we will have to rework or conception of a genotype that is comprised of reference and alternate components.

2. Consider that &apos;genotype&apos; is used to refer to variation of a whole genome, of a single locus, or even a single base (see http://snpedia.com/index.php/Appearance) . . . . should we model these different types of genotypes into our model as &apos;genomic genotype&apos;, &apos;locus genotype&apos;, &apos;sequence genotype&apos;, etc.</obo:DAO_0000002>

        <obo:DAO_0000001>1. Note that we are able to classify a &apos;genomic variation complement&apos; as being a &apos;sequence feature collection&apos; (ie necessarily having 2 or more member sequences), despite the fact that the genomic variation complement of some genotypes consists only of a single feature (ie not a collection) - such as the case of a single transgenic insertion, hemizgous X-linked variant, or extrachromosomal array. This is because conceptually, we assign a &apos;null locus&apos; partner to such loci to complete the complement as a collection.  This &apos;null locus&apos; has an extent of zero, and can either be a proper junction (in the case of a transgenic insertion), or a &apos;conceptual locus&apos; that has no true genomic location (in the case of X-linked or extrachromosonal variants). This enables us to consistently and clearly conceptualize, display, and operate on instances of genomic variation complements that take any of these forms.


2. The fact that in some cases, a variant single locus complement is also a genetic variation complement (e.g. fgf8a^ti282a/+ in test instance #1), means we have to be careful about parthood axioms on these classes.

    A. Previously had the axiom has_member only &apos;single locus variant complement&apos;, but because some single locus variant complements (e.g. fgf8a^ti282a/+) are typed as both genetic variation complements and single locus variant complements, this meant that a gene variant such as ti282a, being a member_of fgf8a^ti282a/+,  was beign inferred incorrectly as a single locus variant complement. 

    B. Likewise, cannot say has_part only  &apos;single locus variant complement&apos;, because this wont hold in cases where there is only one single locus variant complement in the genetic variation complement (because has_part is transitive, and single locus variant complements have_member some genomic variant)</obo:DAO_0000001>

        <obo:DAO_0000002>1. Confer with SO to determine if this is OK to map to SO:sequence collection. It may be that out &apos;sequence feature collection&apos; is defined here more broadly than in SO (in that it is a collection of one or more discontinuous sequence features). This allows us to handle cases where, for example, a variant collection&gt;variant single locus complement is just one sequence region (e.g. hemizygous allele, or a transgenic insertion in only one chromosome). In such cases, because we allow for members of a sequence collection to be features (as opposed to regions), there can exist a seqeunce collection even for single transgenic insertions - by pairing with the corresponding location/feature on the homologous chromosome where the insert is absent (so this feature is a junction having an extent of zero). In this way, we can say that &apos;genomic variation complements&apos; are always collections.  

Side Note: If we pursue this apporoach, we dont have to define sequence collection loosely to allow for collections (single-locus variant collections) with only one member (because the second member could always be a junction).  We still need to figure out how to model cases where they zygosity of a transgenic insertion is not known - as there are many of these case in MODs such as ZFIN.

Side Note: A problematic case (if we classify a genome as a sequence feature collection) remains genomes that are one continuous sequence (e.g. a bacterial chromosome) . . . see below

2.  CONSIDER allowing for sequence collections to not be disjoint from features, and possible have only one member (ie treat them like SETS).  Because there are cases where things are often collections with more than one member, but we want to allow for cases where there is only one member (e.g. genomes on a single chromosome, single locus alteration complements that have only one alteration, genomic variation complements that have only one variant single locus complement as part). In general, the notion of a &apos;complement&apos; is tricky because these are often collections but often not. Question is, do we need this disjoint and logically strict definition of collections for some reasoning or inference task?  If not, it would make things easier to do as suggested here. Note that this could also eliminate the need to use null loci  - because the purpose of these is to fulfill the requirement that collections/complements have more than one member.

Other option is to keep this strict distinction, and just assert all complements outside of this divide (as children of sequence information entity)

This enables us to consistently and clearly conceptualize, display, and operate on instances of variant single locus complements that take any of these forms.

As a specific example, consider  a single transgenic insertion on one chromosome.  Here, we can treat the resulting &apos;variant single locus complement&apos; as a &apos;sequence feature collection&apos; with at least two members (the second being a junction with an extent of zero, located at the corresponding position on the homologous chromosome where the transgene is inserted).

        <obo:DAO_0000002>A lot of what is below is required because of how we model variants - where they are required to be variant with some locus.  So for things like transient transgenes we need to conceptualize some &apos;absent locus&apos; that these are variant with.  But there should be a better way to model these as variant without resorting to absent/conceptual classes suich as these.

For absent chromosomes and segments, we may be able to do away with this bad modeling if we focus on the unpaired chromosome/segment as being a member of some VSLC that is variant in having only one member. There should be no need to model the absent chromosome.</obo:DAO_0000002>
        <obo:DAO_0000002>In order to do away with this bad modeling, we need another way to qualify things like transient transgenes and stable extrachromosomal arrays as being variant. Perhaps we dont limit the definition of variants to being variant_with some other real locus (ie alternate versions of some reference locus or locus complement, which these are not), but also include the idea of being novel genetic/genomic content relative to some reference genome.  

So we have two major forms of intrinsic variation: altered content vs novel content.  We need a way to model novel content without resorting to absent/conceptual loci.

1. The idea of being *altered content* relative to some reference genome (i.e. a different version of a genomic locus or locus complement present in this reference).  This covers sequence-based variants, and aneusomic chromosomes/segments.  Here, we allow for variation from a euploid number of copies of a given locus to qualify as variant.  

2. The idea of being *novel content* relative to some reference genome (i.e. representing a new locus that is not present in the reference genome).  This covers variation resulting from entirely new loci (ie those not found in the reference), such as heritable extrachromosomal arrays, and transient transgenes/constructs.  Note that we would consider chromosomally integrated transgenes to be &apos;altered content&apos;, not &apos;novel content&apos;, because they represent an altered version of the junction where they were integrated, and potentiall disrupt the function of a defined locus containing this junction.</obo:DAO_0000002>

The diifference between a genomic loci and an allele is one of scale and context.  The notion of an allele appllies for genomic loci where more than one sequecne has been identified. Alleles exist at known marker or position in a reference genome  - typically spanning the extent of a gene, QTL, or microsattelite region, or the extent of a specific subsequence of such features down to a single nucleotide. (So it is common to talk about alleles of a gene, QTL, microsattelite, or base)

Larger features such as chromosomes and chromosomal regions qualify as genomic loci but are not considered under the scope of the term &apos;allele&apos;. Likewise, extrachromosomal material/replicons that are stably incorporated into a genome are genomic loci but not considered alleles in the context of that genome - because they don&apos;t represent a marker or positionin the reference genome.</obo:DAO_0000001>
        <obo:DAO_0000001>The difference between a &apos;genetic locus&apos; and &apos;genomic locus&apos; is subtle, and the labels of these classes are not particularly intuitive. But I think distinguishing these concepts is important.  A &apos;genetic locus&apos; covers any sequence that is about a region of a physical sequence molecule that is a template for gene expression in some biological system (ie a cell or virion). &apos;Genomic locus&apos; references only regions of heritable nucleic acid molecule parts of a cell or virion (ie parts of the genome). So things like transiently-expressed transgene sequences that are introduced to a cell or organism only at the time of experiment would be considered &apos;&apos;genetic material&apos; but not &apos;genomic material&apos;.</obo:DAO_0000001>

But this is shoddy modeling.  We need a different way to classify these things as variant, which may require changing the logical definition of the variant locus class. 

Some thoughts: we have two major forms of intrinsic variation: altered content vs novel content.  We need a way to model novel content without resorting to absent/conceptual loci that it is &apos;variant_with&apos;.

1. The idea of being *altered content* relative to some reference genome (i.e. a different version of a genomic locus or locus complement present in this reference).  This covers sequence-based variants, and aneusomic chromosomes/segments.  Here, we allow for variation from a euploid number of copies of a given locus to qualify as variant (e.g. so that a monoploid chromosome is a variant locus - but have not modeled this yet)

2. The idea of being *novel content* relative to some reference genome (i.e. representing a new locus that is not present in the reference genome).  This covers variation resulting from entirely new loci (ie those not found in the reference), such as heritable extrachromosomal arrays, and transient transgenes/constructs.  Note that we would consider chromosomally integrated transgenes to be &apos;altered content&apos;, not &apos;novel content&apos;, because they represent an altered version of the junction where they were integrated, and potentiall disrupt the function of a defined locus containing this junction.

The diifference between a genomic loci and an allele is one of scale and context.  The notion of an allele appllies for genomic loci where more than one sequecne has been identified. Alleles exist at known marker or position in a reference genome  - typically spanning the extent of a gene, QTL, or microsattelite region, or the extent of a specific subsequence of such features down to a single nucleotide. (So it is common to talk about alleles of a gene, QTL, microsattelite, or base)

Larger features such as chromosomes and chromosomal regions qualify as genomic loci but are not considered under the scope of the term &apos;allele&apos;. Likewise, extrachromosomal material/replicons that are stably incorporated into a genome are genomic loci but not considered alleles in the context of that genome - because they don&apos;t represent a marker or position in the reference genome.</obo:DAO_0000001>

At present, we do not require this parthood. This is because these seqeunce classes will be aligned with/taken from SO, and in SO they are considered ICEs.  So we need not be concerned with whether a genomic locus or a gene must be encoded in the material genome of an organism or not.  Because these are sequence information entities that are about some nucleic acid, and not sequence that is encoded in some nucleic acid. Thus, the context of the physical nucleid acid is of no import.  These classes are loci in virtue of the fact that they are associated with some specific coordinates in some genomic sequence record, and not in virtue of the fact that they are encoded in the actual genetic material that is defined/delimited by such coordinates.

There is then no simple/direct way to associate a GENO:&apos;genomic locus&apos; with &apos;genetic material&apos; (ie the nucleic acid part of a cell or virion that encodes its genome).  A &apos;genomic locus&apos; sequence need not be about some &apos;genetic material&apos;.  Rather, it can be about some plasmid insert that carries sequence of a genomic locus (e.g. a gene).
