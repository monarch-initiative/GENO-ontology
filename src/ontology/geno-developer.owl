        <obo:GENO_0000257>In GENO we define three levels of sequence artifacts: (1) biological sequences, (2) sequence features, and (3) qualified sequence features.

(1) The identify criteria for a &apos;biological sequence&apos; include only its inherent sequence (the ordered string of units that comprise it).
(2) The identity criteria for a &apos;sequence feature&apos; include its sequence and position (where it resides - i.e. its location based on how it maps to a reference or standard)
(3) The identity criteria for a &apos;qualified sequence feature&apos; include its sequence, position, and the material context or state of its bearer in a cell or organism. This context can include its direct epigenetic modification, its being targeted by gene knockdown reagents such as morpholinos or RNAi, its being transiently overexpressed from a transgenic construct in a cell or organism, or its residing in a specific subcellular or anatomical location.</obo:GENO_0000257>
        <obo:GENO_0000258>At present the definitions of qualified features link them to variaton in expression - ultimately may not want to make this committment - e.g. the context doesnt have to be something that affects expression level.

        <obo:GENO_0000258>A lot of what is below is required because of how we model variants - where they are required to be variant with some locus.  So for things like transient transgenes we need to conceptualize some &apos;absent locus&apos; that these are variant with.  But there should be a better way to model these as variant without resorting to absent/conceptual classes suich as these.

For absent chromosomes and segments, we may be able to do away with this bad modeling if we focus on the unpaired chromosome/segment as being a member of some VSLC that is variant in having only one member. There should be no need to model the absent chromosome.</obo:GENO_0000258>
        <obo:GENO_0000258>In order to do away with this bad modeling, we need another way to qualify things like transient transgenes and stable extrachromosomal arrays as being variant. Perhaps we dont limit the definition of variants to being variant_with some other real locus (ie alternate versions of some reference locus or locus complement, which these are not), but also include the idea of being novel genetic/genomic content relative to some reference genome.  

So we have two major forms of intrinsic variation: altered content vs novel content.  We need a way to model novel content without resorting to absent/conceptual loci.

1. The idea of being *altered content* relative to some reference genome (i.e. a different version of a genomic locus or locus complement present in this reference).  This covers sequence-based variants, and aneusomic chromosomes/segments.  Here, we allow for variation from a euploid number of copies of a given locus to qualify as variant.  

2. The idea of being *novel content* relative to some reference genome (i.e. representing a new locus that is not present in the reference genome).  This covers variation resulting from entirely new loci (ie those not found in the reference), such as heritable extrachromosomal arrays, and transient transgenes/constructs.  Note that we would consider chromosomally integrated transgenes to be &apos;altered content&apos;, not &apos;novel content&apos;, because they represent an altered version of the junction where they were integrated, and potentiall disrupt the function of a defined locus containing this junction.</obo:GENO_0000258>

Alleles exist at known marker or position in a reference genome  - typically spanning the extent of a gene, QTL, or microsattelite region, or the extent of a specific subsequence of such features down to a single nucleotide.

        <obo:GENO_0000257>Should a &apos;genomic locus&apos; and a &apos;genome&apos; necessarily be about the &apos;genetic material&apos; that is part_of some cell or virion, or should they be able to be encoded in nucleic acids that are not part of a cell or virion&apos;s genome. At present, we do not require this parthood. This is because these seqeunce classes will be aligned with/taken from SO, and in SO they are considered ICEs.  So we need not be concerned with whether a genomic locus or a gene must be encoded in the material genome of an organism or not.  Because these are sequence information entities that are about some nucleic acid, and not sequence that is encoded in some nucleic acid. Thus, the context of the physical nucleid acid is of no import.  These classes are loci in virtue of the fact that they are associated with some specific coordinates in some genomic sequence record, and not in virtue of the fact that they are encoded in the actual genetic material that is defined/delimited by such coordinates.

There is then no simple/direct way to associate a GENO:&apos;genomic locus&apos; with &apos;genetic material&apos; (ie the nucleic acid part of a cell or virion that encodes its genome).  A &apos;genomic locus&apos; sequence need not be about some &apos;genetic material&apos;.  Rather, it can be about some plasmid insert that carries sequence of a genomic locus (e.g. a gene).  What is true is that a genomic locus must be about/ some nucleic acid that represents abstract sequence information that is encoded somewhere in the genetic material of a cell or virion (even if the instance under consideration is not so encoded).</obo:GENO_0000257>

But I think distinguishing these concepts is important.  A &apos;genetic locus&apos; covers any sequence that is about a region of a physical sequence molecule that is a template for gene expression in some biological system (ie a cell or virion). &apos;Genomic locus&apos; references only regions of heritable nucleic acid molecule parts of a cell or virion (ie parts of the genome). So things like transiently-expressed transgene sequences that are introduced to a cell or organism only at the time of experiment would be considered &apos;&apos;genetic material&apos; but not &apos;genomic material&apos;.</obo:GENO_0000257>

        <obo:GENO_0000258>The logical definition here is simple because we model conceptual/absent loci so that we can say that variants such as extrachromosomal replicons and transient transgenes are variant_with something, andthus classify as variants.  But this is shoddy modeling.  We need a different way to classify these things as variant, which may require changing the logical definition of the variant locus class. 

Some thoughts: we have two major forms of intrinsic variation: altered content vs novel content.  We need a way to model novel content without resorting to absent/conceptual loci that it is &apos;variant_with&apos;.

1. The idea of being *altered content* relative to some reference genome (i.e. a different version of a genomic locus or locus complement present in this reference).  This covers sequence-based variants, and aneusomic chromosomes/segments.

This covers variation resulting from entirely new loci (ie those not found in the reference), such as heritable extrachromosomal arrays, and transient transgenes/constructs.

This is the case in the clinvar data. And in the coriell data - where we cant always accurately represent the variant locus if there is more than one seqauence alteration affecting a gene, because we dont know if the two alterations are cis or trans.

Other terms such as &apos;subregion&apos;, segment&apos;, or &apos;member&apos; are not general enough to cover all such cases, but are used to label subclasses where they are appropriate.

2. Modeling not complete here yet. These will be useful for modeling transgene components, when we get to that stage.

        <obo:GENO_0000257>Note that we are able to classify a &apos;variant single locus complement&apos; as being a &apos;sequence feature collection&apos; (ie necessarily having 2 or more member sequences), despite the fact that the variant single locus complement of some genotypes consists only of a single feature (ie not a collection) - such as the case of a single transgenic insertion, hemizgous X-linked variant, or extrachromosomal array.  This is because conceptually, we assign a &apos;null locus&apos; partner to such loci to complete the complement as a collection.  This null locus has an extent of zero (see notes in the &apos;null locus&apos; branch), and can either be a proper junction (in the case of a transgenic insertion), or an &apos;absent/conceptual locus&apos; that has no true genomic location (in the case of X-linked or extrachromosonal variants).  This enables us to consistently and clearly conceptualize, display, and operate on instances of variant single locus complements that take any of these forms.

As a specific example, consider  a single transgenic insertion on one chromosome.  Here, we can treat the resulting &apos;variant single locus complement&apos; as a &apos;sequence feature collection&apos; with at least two members (the second being a junction with an extent of zero, located at the corresponding position on the homologous chromosome where the transgene is inserted). Again, in this way, we can consistently model &apos;genomic variation complements&apos; and &apos;variant single locus complements&apos; as necessarily being &apos;sequence feature collections&apos;, the former being comprised of one or more of the latter.

        <obo:GENO_0000258>1. Confer with SO to determine if this is OK to map to SO:sequence collection. It may be that out &apos;sequence feature collection&apos; is defined here more broadly than in SO (in that it is a collection of one or more discontinuous sequence features). This allows us to handle cases where, for example, a variant collection&gt;variant single locus complement is just one sequence region (e.g. hemizygous allele, or a transgenic insertion in only one chromosome). In such cases, because we allow for members of a sequence collection to be features (as opposed to regions), there can exist a seqeunce collection even for single transgenic insertions - by pairing with the corresponding location/feature on the homologous chromosome where the insert is absent (so this feature is a junction having an extent of zero). In this way, we can say that &apos;genomic variation complements&apos; are always collections.  

Side Note: If we pursue this apporoach, we dont have to define sequence collection loosely to allow for collections (single-locus variant collections) with only one member (because the second member could always be a junction).  We still need to figure out how to model cases where they zygosity of a transgenic insertion is not known - as there are many of these case in MODs such as ZFIN.

Side Note: A problematic case (if we classify a genome as a sequence feature collection) remains genomes that are one continuous sequence (e.g. a bacterial chromosome) . . . see below

2.  CONSIDER allowing for sequence collections to not be disjoint from features, and possible have only one member (ie treat them like SETS).  Because there are cases where things are often collections with more than one member, but we want to allow for cases where there is only one member (e.g. genomes on a single chromosome, single locus alteration complements that have only one alteration, genomic variation complements that have only one variant single locus complement as part). In general, the notion of a &apos;complement&apos; is tricky because these are often collections but often not. Question is, do we need this disjoint and logically strict definition of collections for some reasoning or inference task?  If not, it would make things easier to do as suggested here. Note that this could also eliminate the need to use null loci  - because the purpose of these is to fulfill the requirement that collections/complements have more than one member.

Other option is to keep this strict distinction, and just assert all complements outside of this divide (as children of sequence information entity)

        <obo:GENO_0000257>1. Note that we are able to classify a &apos;genomic variation complement&apos; as being a &apos;sequence feature collection&apos; (ie necessarily having 2 or more member sequences), despite the fact that the genomic variation complement of some genotypes consists only of a single feature (ie not a collection) - such as the case of a single transgenic insertion, hemizgous X-linked variant, or extrachromosomal array. This is because conceptually, we assign a &apos;null locus&apos; partner to such loci to complete the complement as a collection.  This &apos;null locus&apos; has an extent of zero, and can either be a proper junction (in the case of a transgenic insertion), or a &apos;conceptual locus&apos; that has no true genomic location (in the case of X-linked or extrachromosonal variants). This enables us to consistently and clearly conceptualize, display, and operate on instances of genomic variation complements that take any of these forms.


2. The fact that in some cases, a variant single locus complement is also a genetic variation complement (e.g. fgf8a^ti282a/+ in test instance #1), means we have to be careful about parthood axioms on these classes.

    A. Previously had the axiom has_member only &apos;single locus variant complement&apos;, but because some single locus variant complements (e.g. fgf8a^ti282a/+) are typed as both genetic variation complements and single locus variant complements, this meant that a gene variant such as ti282a, being a member_of fgf8a^ti282a/+,  was beign inferred incorrectly as a single locus variant complement. 

    B. Likewise, cannot say has_part only  &apos;single locus variant complement&apos;, because this wont hold in cases where there is only one single locus variant complement in the genetic variation complement (because has_part is transitive, and single locus variant complements have_member some genomic variant)</obo:GENO_0000257>
