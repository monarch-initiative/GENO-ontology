comment: Indels can have a different number of bases than the corresponding reference sequence. The term name was changed from indel to delins on 2/24/2019 to align with the HGVS nomenclature term for a deletion-insertion. Indel was causing confusion in the annotation community (github issue 445). The HGVS nomenclature definition of deletion-insertion (delins) is a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are replaced by one or more other nucleotides and which is not a substitution, inversion or conversion.
